# PCAR
Path-connected aggregate recognition of diffraction-limited images

The software is provided as a one executable file `DiffLimAnalyseFolder.exe`. To run it you need to install version 9.9 (R2020b) of the MATLAB Runtime (https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html). If you already have MATLAB, you probably can run the executable file `DiffLimAnalyseFolder.exe` right away.
